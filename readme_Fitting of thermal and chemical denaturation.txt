Methods, materials and software:
Thermal denaturation profiles at different GdnHCl concentrations were measured by Prometheus Panta, NanoTemper (Munich, Germany), using intrinsic fluorescence intensity as a probe for the level of folding. 10 uM full-length JB6 and its NTD were prepared in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and GdnHCl concentrations in the range of 0 to 4 M. Prometheus high sensitivity capillaries were used for measurements. Thermal denaturation experiments were conducted between 20C and 95C at a rate of 0.5C/min, both forward and reverse.
